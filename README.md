## About

It's made using Google Chrome. May work in other browsers.

Made under a short deadline with no need to create maintainable code :)

This is a project based on <https://github.com/joakimk/livecoding_workspace>.

# Development

## Installing

Before you start, ensure you have Node and Elixir installed. I'm using Elixir 1.3.0 and Node v5.5.0, but other versions will likely work as well.

    mix deps.get
    npm install

## Editing code

Start the server

    mix phoenix.server

## Editing the music sync
